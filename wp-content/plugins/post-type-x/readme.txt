To show items from just one category, use: [show_products category="2"] where 2 is category ID (it's possible to display several categories by inserting comma separated IDs). 

To display items by IDs, use: [show_products product="5"], where 5 is item ID.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Catalog X and eCommerce Product Catalog? =

Catalog X is a simple and extensible base on which you can built your deeply customized product catalog, services list, portfolio etc. It has only basic features. While developing eCommerce Product Catalog we realized that many users are trying to disable some functionality because they don't need it. That's why we came up with Catalog X which can be extended but it doesn't force any functionality.

Catalog X and eCommerce Product Catalog share the same base so you can switch between them without loosing configuration, products and categories.

== Screenshots ==

The screenshots below show the example usage of Catalog X as a product catalog:

1. Catalog X main listing with categories and items enabled. The "Modern Grid" listing design is used here.
2. Catalog X main listing with categories and items enabled. The "Classic List" listing design is used here.
3. Catalog X main listing with categories and items enabled. The "Classic Grid" listing design is used here.
4. Simple product page with additional images in description
5. Main catalog settings screen
6. Categories, SEO and breadcrumbs settings


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of impleCode Catalog X, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Catalog X” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found Catalog X plugin you can view details about it such as the the rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our item catalog plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the plugin pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
